-- Programming tools used: SQL (PostgreSQL & PgAdmin)
-- Note: This public dataset was retrieved from Kaggle
at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

-- Context: This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like
gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.

-- Attribute information:
1) id: unique identifier
2) gender: 'Male', 'Female', or 'Other'
3) age: age of the patient
4) hypertension: 0 if the patient does not have hypertension, 1 if the patient does have hypertension
5) heart_disease: 0 if the patient does not have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient does have a heart disease
6) ever_married: 'No', or 'Yes'
7) work_type: 'children', 'govt_job', 'never_worked', 'private', or 'self-employed'
8) residence_type: 'rural', or 'urban'
9) avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood
10) bmi: body mass index
11) smoking_status: 'formerly smoked', 'never smoked', 'smokes', or 'unknown'
12) stroke: 0 if the patient has not had a stroke, 1 if the patient has had a stroke

Male   |   108 | 5.1063829787234043

- The result shows that about 5.1% of the males in the dataset have had a stroke.

- The above query result is limited to 20 rows.
- We can see that patients with an age over 55 in the dataset are the majority that have had a stroke.

 /* Does BMI have an influence on stroke? */

- Note: The guide for BMI according to National Institute of Health (NIH):
        Less than 18.5 is underweight
        Between 18.5 and 24.9 is ideal
        Between 25 and 29.9 is overweight
        More than 30 is obesity

SELECT count(bmi),

-------+----------------------+---------------------+---------------------
 4909 |  28.8932369117946629 | 28.8230638297872340 | 30.4712918660287081

 - Note: The query result does not include the 201 null values of the total 5110 count of data.
 - The average bmi of all of the patients in the dataset is about 28.89
 - The average bmi of patients that have not had a stroke is about 28.82
 - The average bmi of patients that have had a stroke is about 30.47
 - These results prove that there is a correlation between bmi and stroke.
